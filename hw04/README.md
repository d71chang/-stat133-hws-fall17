# HW 04 Grades Visualizer


Using raw data of fictional STAT 133 scores, we calculate the letter grade distributions of the class and visualize relationships between pairs of different types of scores by creating an R Shiny web app. We also apply concepts of various packages such as dplyr and testthat for writing functions and unit tests for data wrangling. Generating summary statistics help us to then analyze the association between pairs of scores that make up the overall letter grade.
